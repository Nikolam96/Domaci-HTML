            Jackie's brother <a href="#">Richie Aprile</a> is released from prison, proving to be uncontrollable in the business arena, siding more with Junior than Tony, despite the fact that Tony is the acting boss of the family after Junior's arrest. Richie starts a relationship with 
            <a href="#">Janice</a>, Tony's sister, who has arrived from Seattle to take care of their mother. 
            <a href="#">"Big Pussy"</a> returns to New Jersey after a conspicuous absence.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="#">Christopher Moltisanti</a> becomes engaged to his girlfriend <a href="#">Adriana La Cerva</a>, despite his past abuse. <a href="#">Matthew Bevilaqua</a> and <a href="#">Sean Gismonte</a>, two low-level associates dissatisfied with their perceived lack of success in the Soprano crew, try to make a name for themselves by attempting to kill Christopher as a favor to Richie, even though he didn't ask them to. Their plan fails and Christopher kills Sean, but Christopher is critically wounded. He manages to recover after surgery. Tony and Big Pussy locate Matthew and kill him. A witness to the murder goes to the FBI and identifies Tony, but later retracts his statement.
